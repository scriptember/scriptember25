## 🛠 Contribution Guidelines

* **Branching strategy:**

  * `main` → Stable production-ready code.
  * `dev` → Active development.
  * Feature branches → `feature/your-feature-name`

* **Pull Requests (PRs):**

  * Always link an issue to your PR.
  * Request at least one reviewer (preferably a mentor for major changes).
  * Write clear commit messages.

* **Code Style:**

  * Follow ESLint/Prettier rules (configured in the repo).
  * Use meaningful variable and function names.
  * Write unit tests where applicable.

## 🧑‍🏫 Mentorship Guidelines

* Mentors should:

  * Review and provide **constructive feedback** on PRs.
  * Suggest **improvements** rather than imposing solutions.
  * Share **resources, tutorials, or references** for learning.
  * Help collaborators understand **why** certain decisions are made.

* Communication should be open, respectful, and transparent.
